## <span style="color: #27ae60; font-family: 'Arial';">Introduction</span>
The goal of this project is to analyze the ObesityDataSet, examining variables such as age, height, weight, and lifestyle factors to uncover patterns and insights related to obesity.

## <span style="color: #27ae60; font-family: 'Arial';">Dataset</span>
The dataset used for this analysis is called "ObesityDataSet_raw_and_data_synthetic." It includes columns like Gender, Age, Height, Weight, family_history_with_overweight, and more.

## <span style="color: #27ae60; font-family: 'Arial';">Analysis Steps</span>
1. **Data Cleaning:** We started by cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and performing deduplication.
2. **Descriptive Statistics:** Utilized descriptive statistics to understand the central tendencies and variability of numerical and categorical variables.
3. **Bivariate Analysis:** Explored relationships between pairs of variables to identify patterns and correlations.
4. **Multivariate Analysis:** Examined interactions among three or more variables for a comprehensive understanding of interdependencies.
5. **Visualizations:** Generated visualizations, including histograms, scatter plots, and pair plots, to illustrate data distributions and relationships.

## <span style="color: #27ae60; font-family: 'Arial';">Conclusion</span>
In conclusion, the analysis provides valuable insights into the factors contributing to obesity. Understanding these patterns can inform future studies and interventions aimed at addressing and preventing obesity-related issues.
